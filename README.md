# ReactionTimeWidgets
Widgets and simple applets to record reaction time, hand-eye coordination, and other user parameters. These widgets are meant to be used either as standalone applets or from within a Learning Management System like Moodle.

The click on the square widget is inspired by [https://github.com/Muhammad-Adeel-322/-Random-Box-Clicker-Game].
